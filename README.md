# Face-Anti-Spoofing-Detection
Face presentation attack detection is critical for ensuring the robustness of 
biometric systems. This project explores the training and evaluation of two state
of-the-art deep learning models, EfficientNetB7 and ResNet50, for detecting 
presentation attacks using the SynthASpoof dataset.
<br>  The dataset includes bonafide images and various synthetic attack images. 
<br>  Both models were fine-tuned on this dataset, and their performances were compared in terms of 
accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix metrics. 
<br> The dataset is systematically divided into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%) 
subsets.
