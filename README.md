# Face-Anti-Spoofing-Detection
Face presentation attack detection is critical for ensuring the robustness of 
biometric systems. This project explores the training and evaluation of two state
of-the-art deep learning models, EfficientNetB7 and ResNet50, for detecting 
presentation attacks using the SynthASpoof dataset
<br>  The dataset includes 
bonafide images and various synthetic attack images.
